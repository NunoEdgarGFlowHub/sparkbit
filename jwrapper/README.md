To build SparkBit for distribution.

Download latest version of JWrapper and the JRE packs into this folder.  You probably don't want your SCM to commit them, as they are large.
```
http://www.jwrapper.com/download.html
```

To build, run the command:
```
./make.sh
```

The first time will take a very long time.  Go get a coffee and come back in 30 minutes.

If everything was successful, check the builds folder for the distributable binaries.
